Four separate visualizations made using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>'s Streamgraph and Parallel Coordinates to visualize students' graduation and retention rates.

Data from several colleges within UNC Charlotte were used, as well as 17 universities in the UNC system.

Dataset is available <a href="https://ir.uncc.edu/">here</a>.

This was for a research project and is no longer being maintained.

We were trying to identify a way to easily spot trends in time series data.  The Streamgraph vis seemed best suited for this task.
